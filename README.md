Modelv1 represents the current model module. This is intended to be used in addition to modelv1_input. Modelv1_original is the stand alone program that contains the plotting code and allows you to plot in the same document. 

Wolframtest is simply just experimental code to visualise the setup for the wolframclient library to use Mathematica in Python. Mostly unrelated to other files as of present.
